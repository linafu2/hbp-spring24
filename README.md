# Under the Sea Productivity
Created by: Sanjana, Gillian, Lina, and Sophia

This is a Chrome extension to hold users accountable for their productivity and motivate users to work.

Users select which tabs are unproductive through settings. They can then set a timer for how long they're allowed to be on those unproductive tabs for. As the timer counts down, the screen fills up with a water and swimming fish animation until the entire tab is filled and cannot be used when time is up, making the user get to work!
