# Under the Sea Productivity
Created by: Sanjana, Gillian, Lina, and Sophia

This is a Chrome extension to hold users accountable for their productivity and motivate users to work.

Users select which tabs are unproductive through settings.

Users can choose how much time they are allowed to be on those unproductive tabs for.

As the timer counts down, the screen fills up with a water and swimming fish animation until the entire tab is filled- and cannot be used when time is up.
